# project0

Develop a simple Farm Management System in C++. This system should:
- Add new crops to the farm.
- Register instances of each crop type.
- Get the total count of each crop type.
- Display details of the crops.
  - How long it has been planted
  - How many days until harvest
  - Expected profit
- Keep track of the day in the farm, and increment the day with a function call
- When the crop has been made, automatically harvest the crop after the duration for harvest
- Put the crop profit sum into the farm budget


Starter code is provided. You will need to modify the code to add in all of the features of the project.
Make sure your code does not have any memory leaks and that you write test cases to ensure the code runs as intended.
